        <h1>Hitz Family Recipes</h1>
        <p>
          The following is a list of recipies that were compiled by Veray Hitz over the 
          course of several decades and are among the family's favorites. The recipes were
          originaly scanned and uploaded onto a website by Paul Hitz. However, due to the 
          quaity of many of the original documents Leonard Hitz decided to put all of the 
          recipies onto a new website in order to make the recipes easier to read.
